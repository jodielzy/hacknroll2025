## Inspiration
While taking the CS1010 course, which required working exclusively in vim, we found learning and memorizing shortcuts challenging. With mouse actions disabled, it became evident that there was no simple and effective way to refer to or learn productivity shortcuts. This lack of accessibility made mastering vim a frustrating experience. Reflecting on this, we realized that if there had been a web application designed to teach and reinforce these shortcuts in an engaging manner, we would have learned vim more easily, significantly boosting my productivity. This insight inspired the idea for a web application focused on simplifying shortcut learning and making it accessible for everyone.

## Motivation
In today's digital era, the use of computers has become an integral part of daily life. Computers play an indispensable role in improving efficiency and accessibility. However, not everyone finds it easy to adapt to this rapidly evolving technology.

The elderly often struggle to keep up with technological advancements. Tasks that involve using a mouse or trackpad can be particularly difficult due to shaky hands or reduced motor control. In contrast, keyboard shortcuts can provide a more efficient and less frustrating way to interact with devices. Learning these shortcuts not only improves their ability to use computers but also increases their likelihood of staying engaged with technology and retaining this newfound knowledge.

For young children, learning shortcuts early on can serve as a valuable life skill. As computers become more ingrained in education and daily life, teaching children to use shortcuts enhances their productivity and equips them for the future.

By catering to beginners, this application aims to make learning shortcuts an engaging and rewarding experience, fostering confidence and proficiency in computer usage.

## Target Audience
The target audience for this shortcut application includes elderly users and young children. The application is designed primarily for Windows and Google Chrome systems, as these are widely popular platforms.

## Features
•  Tutorial Mode provides a visually engaging interface designed to simplify the learning process with clear, step-by-step directives. It has vibrant visuals which emulate real-world actions performed by the shortcuts.  Hints and tips are available along the way to aid unfamiliar users, ensuring accessibility for all skill levels.

•  How to Play acts as a quick-start guide, helping users understand the app's different features and modes. This section breaks down the gameplay mechanics, explaining how to interact with the app effectively. Whether it’s navigating through Tutorial Mode or competing in a 1v1 challenge, the instructions are designed to be clear, accessible, and visually pleasing. 

•  Race is a 1v1 Mode that offers a vibrant and competitive environment to test their shortcut knowledge. It is enhanced by real-time visual feedback, dynamic progress bars, and captivating graphics. Each player is tasked with completing shortcut-based directives under timed conditions, testing their speed and accuracy. Whether competing with friends, family, or colleagues, the 1v1 Mode turns shortcut learning into an exciting and interactive experience.
